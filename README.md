I know this isn't what a read me is for but fuck it. Lately I've been feeling like I needed to do something -- however inconsequential -- to acknowledge this whole debate surroudning women in tech/journalism/startups. The issues seem so much bigger than me, so I'm going to try and do very small things that make me feel better. 

First up, a lil python script for the goal of achieving gender parity with my Twitter followers. Earlier today I followed 355 people on Twitter, of which 213 were male and 102 were female (the rest organizatinos or fakes). So I unfollowed about 50 men and followed 50 more women with the hope that the flood of voices I listen to every day are a little more balanced.

Baby steps
