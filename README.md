I know this isn't what a read me is for but fuck it. Lately I've been feeling like I needed to do something -- however inconsequential -- to acknowledge this whole debate surrounding women in tech/journalism/startups. The issue seem so much bigger than me that it's hard to do anyting meaningful, so I'm going to try and do very small things.

First up, a lil python script with the goal of achieving gender parity in your Twitter followers. Earlier today I followed 355 people on Twitter, of which 213 were male and 102 were female (the rest organizatinos or fakes). So I used this script to learn that I needed to unfollow about 50 men and follow 50 more women. The hope was just to make the flood of information I consume every day on Twitter a little more balanced.
